# Calendar-App

This is a react app, calendar layout that connects to a backend using Node, Mongo and Express tools. In it there are authentication processes, tokens, keys, etc.

To use it, you must first build the database, if you need to try it you can write to my email jeancadames22@gmail.com.

For the design of the app, various dependencies were used, the calendar has the functionality of saving events that persist in the user's account, it can present the events in different views, on a monthly, weekly and daily basis.

The entire app was made from scratch, the API, the database, all the authentication processes, verifications and authentications, etc.
